# Cockatiel

an electron app that monitors stream for cmds, then uses tts to read message

## important notes:

this is built and made for macOS, it should work on linux with minimal issue/debugging but it has not been tested their yet.
as for windows i have 0 idea thuogh it depends on some shell commands so you likely will need to to a lot of work to make it work.

everything here will be written from the perspective of macOS, at the moment if you're on a different platform you're on your own.

## needs:

- node ```brew install node```
- gcloud sdk ```brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk```

## todo:

lots and lots of things
